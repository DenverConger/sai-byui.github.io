All the projects that the society's members work on is public. The repositories are located [here](https://github.com/sai-byui).\r\n\r\n##Projects\r\n###Fall 2016\r\n####Autonomous Remote Control Car\r\nAn RC car is made to autonomously traverse to the end point given to it on a map which is also provided. The map is analyzed and the optimal path is found using a popular pathfinding algorithm, called Dijkstra's algorithm. A Raspberry Pi 3 is used to control to car. The source code and the wiki can be found in the [repository](https://github.com/sai-byui/arcc).\r\n\r\n####Digit Classifier \r\nA neural network is implemented from scratch in C++ to analyze handwritten digits from a picture.   \r\n  \r\n### Contact\r\n\r\nFor more information, please contact sofai.byui@gmail.com\r\n",
