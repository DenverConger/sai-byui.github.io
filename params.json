All the projects that the society's members work on is public. The repositories are located [here](https://github.com/sai-byui).\r\n\r\n##Projects\r\n###Fall 2016\r\n####Autonomous Remote Control Car\r\nAn RC car is made to autonomously traverse to the end point given to it on a map which is also provided. The map is analyzed and the optimal path is found using a popular pathfinding algorithm, called Dijkstra's algorithm. This project is implemented in C++. A Raspberry Pi 3 is used to control to car. The source code and the wiki can be found in the [repository](https://github.com/sai-byui/arcc).\r\n\r\n####Digit Classifier \r\nA neural network is implemented from scratch in C++(or python) to analyze handwritten digits from a picture. The project will begin working with simple images and scale up towards HD images.\r\n\r\n####Bot Arena\r\nUsing the Pygames module to build a virtual arena in Python, two teams (Red & Blue) will develop their gaming A.I. agent to battle one another to the death. Different algorithms used for game character development will be implemented in order to create the most adaptable agent for the arena.\r\n\r\n####Tin Man Gift\r\nThis project involves defining the ethics of human society into programmable logic for an A.I. agent to set priorities and determine its actions. This can be applied either to military applications such as rules of engagement on the battlefield for autonomous weapons, or it can focus on a more civilian setting such as household robots or self-driving cars.\r\n\r\n####Words Are Things\r\nThis project involves building data structures for Natural Language Processing(NLP). Designing abstract data types for \"words\" and \"sentences\", the team will create a program which takes pseudo-code commands from a user and creates compiling Python code.\r\n  \r\n### Contact\r\n\r\nFor more information, please contact sofai.byui@gmail.com\r\n",
